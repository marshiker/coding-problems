BUILD:
untar the file
run make

RUN
./merge input-dir-path output-file-path
example:
./merge ./input ./output/output.txt

Time Complexity:
k files with N lines of data
O(k*K*N)
first input processing checks for sortedness O(kN)
second input processing to put lines into minheap and extract minimum O(kN(k+logk)) O(k^2N)
minheap will have atmost k elements at a time
there is a linear search performed on a vector of k to check for duplicates

Space complexity:
input files are not fully loaded into memory at same time,read line by line as needed
space is O(k), data structures allocated or of size k 
output buffer constant size is 256*1000 bytes, after fills written to file
