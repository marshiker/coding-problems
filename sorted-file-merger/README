RUN
./merge input-dir-path output-file-path
example:
./merge ./input ./output/output.txt

Time Complexity:
k files with N lines of data
O(kN(logk))+O(kN) = O(kN(logk))
first input processing checks for sortedness O(kN)
second input processing to put lines into minheap and extract minimum O(kN(logk))
minheap will have atmost k elements at a time

Space complexity:
input files are not fully loaded into memory at same time,read line by line as needed
space is O(k), data structures allocated or of size k
